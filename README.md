# Customer Churn in Telecommunication Industry ðŸ“¡
## Overview 
The telecommunications industry has been growing and facing tough competition every day. Since most companies offer similar products, customers can easily switch to competitors if they have a bad experience. With the rise of the Internet, peopleâ€™s need for connectivity is higher than ever, making it crucial for telecom companies to take good care of their customers. Therefore, in this practice, I will analyze the data on Telecom Companies. The main goal with this project is to learn how to make a web app using Streamlit, an open-source library that is perfectly suited for Data Science. And by doing this, I hope to gain a deep and detailed understanding of customer relationships.

## How to run application

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now run the application with th streamlit command

```
$ streamlit run Homepage.py
```
